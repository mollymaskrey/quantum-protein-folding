Fig 1: Understanding the Protein Folding Results
These three plots show the results of quantum optimization for protein folding, visualized using something called a Ramachandran plot. Think of it like a map showing all the possible ways a protein backbone can bend and twist.
What You're Looking At
Each dot represents one amino acid residue (protein building block) and its backbone angles:

X-axis (Phi φ): How the protein backbone rotates around one specific bond
Y-axis (Psi ψ): How it rotates around another bond
These two angles together determine the 3D shape of the protein backbone

The colored rectangles represent "preferred neighborhoods" where proteins naturally like to fold:

Light Blue Box (around -60°, -45°): The α-helix region - imagine a spiral staircase shape
Light Green Box (around -120°, 120°): The β-sheet region - imagine pleated sheets

Comparing the Three Results

Original (left): Shows where the protein segment started - one residue sitting nicely in the α-helix region. This is likely from the AlphaFold prediction.
ExactSolver (middle): The quantum solver using discrete bins (only 3 angle choices) moved the residue slightly within the α-helix region. It's like having to choose between only "small, medium, or large" T-shirt sizes instead of getting a custom fit.
Hybrid Solver (right): Using continuous variables (any angle value), this solver found angles very close to the original. It's like getting a tailored fit instead of choosing from preset sizes.

What This Means
Both quantum solvers successfully kept the protein in a stable, biologically realistic conformation (the α-helix region). The hybrid solver's continuous optimization gave a more precise result, closely matching the original high-quality structure. This demonstrates that quantum computing can effectively optimize protein structures while respecting the physical constraints of how proteins actually fold in nature.
The fact that we only see one dot instead of four (for a 4-residue segment) suggests the visualization might be showing just one representative residue, or the residues are overlapping at similar angle values.
